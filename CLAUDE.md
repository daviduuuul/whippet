# Whippet — project context

Claude Code plugin: a lean-code discipline ("the least code that actually works") plus
terse, concrete reporting. Shipped through a single-plugin marketplace. MIT, public repo
(`daviduuuul/whippet`).

## Layout — repo root ≠ plugin

The shippable plugin is the **nested `whippet/` dir**; the repo root is the marketplace
wrapper + dev tooling. Don't edit plugin files expecting repo tooling to live beside them.

- `whippet/` — the plugin (`source: ./whippet`)
  - `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — plugin manifest
  - `skills/whippet/SKILL.md` — the discipline itself (**the product**)
  - `commands/` — `/whippet-config` (the **one** on-demand command; the rest of the value runs as autonomous hooks since 2.0)
  - `hooks/` — plugin runtime hooks (`hooks.json`, `whippet-*.js`) + `selftest.js`
  - `scripts/` — deterministic engines + their `*.test.js`: `config-audit.js` (`/whippet-config` + the SessionStart advisory), `deps-audit.js` (the `package.json` advisory hook + `whippet check`), `marker.js` (the `// whippet: … | until: …` parser, used by `check.js`), `check.js` (the `whippet check` pre-commit/CI gate)
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — marketplace entry
- `scripts/` — dev tooling: `bump.js`, `check-manifests.js`, `bench-report.js`, `on-edit.js`
- `benchmarks/` — A/B harness, fixtures, `METHODOLOGY.md`
- `.claude/settings.json` — **repo dev hooks** (not the plugin's)
- `.serena/` — Serena project memory

## Commands

```bash
npm test        # selftest.js + check-manifests.js + judge.js selftest   (CI: Node 22)
npm run bump    # bump version across all 4 manifests — never edit by hand
npm run bench   # aggregate benchmarks/results/* into one scoreboard (CIs, per-category)
```

## Two hook layers — don't conflate them

- **Plugin hooks** (`whippet/hooks/hooks.json`) — ship to users. `SessionStart` →
  `whippet-activate.js`; `UserPromptSubmit` → `whippet-mode-tracker.js`. Mode logic lives in
  `whippet-core.js` (default `full`; persisted in flag file `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/.whippet-active`).
  `PostToolUse(Edit|Write|MultiEdit)` → `whippet-posttooluse.js` (**one** node spawn doing both
  per-edit jobs — ~50ms/edit saved vs two hooks, more on Windows) and `Stop` → `whippet-drift-check.js`
  — code↔docs drift: track edited code vs docs in a per-session state file, surface **one** yellow
  advisory per wave when code changed but no docs did. Logic in `whippet-drift-core.js`; off with
  `WHIPPET_DRIFT_OFF=1`, threshold via `WHIPPET_DRIFT_THRESHOLD`.
  **Autonomous deterministic advisories (2.0):** `SessionStart(startup)` →
  `whippet-config-check.js` (runs the config audit, speaks **only on errors**, `WHIPPET_CONFIG_OFF=1`);
  the deps advisory (deps audit when `package.json` changes — new native-equivalent/duplicate findings,
  deduped per session, `WHIPPET_DEPS_OFF=1`) runs **inside `whippet-posttooluse.js`** (`whippet-deps-core.js`).
  All reuse the `sessionStatePath(kind)` helper in `whippet-drift-core.js` and the engines in `whippet/scripts/`.
- **Repo dev hook** (`.claude/settings.json`) — local only. `PostToolUse(Edit|Write)` →
  `scripts/on-edit.js` reruns the suite when you touch hooks / scripts / manifests / README and
  blocks (exit 2) on failure. Whippet dogfooding its own "always-on runnable check".

## Gotchas

- **Version lives in 4 files** — `package.json` (source of truth), `whippet/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`,
  `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, and the README badge. `check-manifests.js` fails the build on
  any desync, so always `npm run bump` instead of hand-editing.
- **Hooks must never throw** — they read stdin JSON, exit 0 silently, and speak only when a real
  check fails (exit 2 feeds stderr back to the agent). Preserve that contract.
- **Vanilla Node, zero deps** — CommonJS, Node ≥22, no `dependencies` in `package.json`. Don't pull
  a library into hook/script code.
- **Benchmarks are law** (`benchmarks/METHODOLOGY.md`): every README claim must be backed by a paired
  A/B (`off` / one-line `baseline` / `whippet`); correctness is a hard gate; **fixtures stay private**
  (anything public leaks into training); report confidence intervals + per-category splits; never
  self-report numbers from a manifest.

## README — keep it minimal (owner's standing instruction)

The README is **only**: the current version badge + a short paragraph of what the
plugin does + the install block. **Nothing else** — no benchmark tables, no command
lists, no honesty essays, no examples. Keep it accurate (update the one paragraph if
what the plugin does changes) and benchmark-true (no measured edge the A/B doesn't
show). The version badge is one of the four synced manifests — `npm run bump` moves
it, never hand-edit.

## Privacy — never leak private things into the public repo (owner's standing instruction)

This is a **public repo**. Nothing about the owner's private setup belongs in any tracked file
— code, tests, benchmarks, corpora, or docs. Before committing, never include:
- personal paths (`C:\Users\<name>\…`) or the private hub (`C:\ClaudeCode\…`);
- real hook/guard script names, real `settings.json`/MCP config, `MEMORY_FILE_PATH`, or any live
  config from the owner's machine — synthetic corpora use **generic placeholders**
  (`./hooks/*.ps1`, `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `./memory.jsonl`, `C:\path\to\…`, `$env:TEMP\…`);
- secrets / tokens / keys, even in examples (use `${ENV_VAR}` placeholders);
- names of the owner's other projects.

The repo ships **only the product and its public tooling**: the plugin (`whippet/` — skill,
commands, hooks, scripts), the marketplace wrapper, the dev tooling, and benchmarks with sanitized
synthetic data. Private working docs (ideas, roadmaps, research, scratch notes) stay **out of git**,
under the gitignored `research/` or `.scratch/` dirs — never committed. (See `.gitignore`.) This
complements *fixtures stay private* above: when in doubt, sanitize or keep it local.

## Scope discipline (this repo, of all repos)

Whippet's value is a **narrow** scope: leanness where it pays — *the least that actually works,
and nothing left rotting in place*. Three fronts, one discipline — **autonomous since 2.0**
(the review/simplify/ledger/deps commands were removed; the value runs as hooks):
- **Lean code output + terse reporting** — the always-on skill (SessionStart anchor + mode tracker).
- **Lean dependencies** — a `PostToolUse` hook audits `package.json` when it changes (native-equivalent,
  declared-but-unused, duplicate-purpose) and surfaces a quiet advisory; same engine powers `whippet check`.
  Detect-only, deterministic, conservative — covers the gaps the lockfile can't.
- **Lean setup** — `/whippet-config` audits the Claude Code config for drift (dead plugin/hook/MCP
  references, fragile local marketplaces, duplicate components, malformed JSON, orphaned files —
  across `settings.json` and `settings.local.json`); also surfaced **automatically** at session start
  when there are errors. Detect-only; deterministic; covers the *gaps* the schema can't (referents and runtime).

The deterministic checks (deps, config, the `// whippet:` marker rule) are also composable as
**`whippet check`** — an exit-coded pre-commit/CI gate (`scripts/check.js`), the mechanizable subset
of the lean-code front hoisted out of the LLM commands. It composes the existing `audit()` functions,
never reimplements them; markers/budget scope to the staged diff. Keep it to *aggregating whippet's own
deterministic audits + a diff budget* — not a linter/formatter/test-runner.

Still **out of scope**: planning, orchestration, general context-engineering — anything that
doesn't serve leanness. New behavior ships with a runnable check (`selftest.js` or
`scripts/*.test.js`), and if it makes a public claim, a benchmark to back it.
