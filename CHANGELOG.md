# Changelog

All notable changes to this plugin. Versions follow the `vX.Y.Z` git tags.

## [Unreleased]

## [3.1.0] - 2026-06-27

Six new conservative checks and a mid-session advisory. Config-eval recall 98.8% → 99.0%,
zero false positives — verified by an independent adversarial false-positive sweep (URLs, prose
filenames, flag-glued args, every MCP transport, malformed input).

### Added
- New `config-audit` checks, each firing only on the unambiguous case:
  - a dead **`enabledMcpjsonServers`** reference — a name absent from the co-located `.mcp.json`;
  - a **stdio MCP server whose entry script is missing** (only the entry point is inspected, so a
    flag-glued arg or a data file ending in `.js`/`.py` is never mistaken for the script);
  - an **`http` hook with no `url`**, and a **`command`-type statusLine with no command** — both inert;
  - a **matcher set on a hook event that ignores matchers** (the filter is silently dropped);
  - a **duplicate hook command** under the same matcher (info — Claude Code de-duplicates these).
- A **mid-session config-drift advisory**: a `PreToolUse` + `PostToolUse` pair on edits to
  `settings.json` / `settings.local.json` prints one quiet line **only when the edit introduces a
  new error**, compared against the pre-edit state and scoped to the edited file. Errors only
  (warnings/info wait for `/whippet-config`); silence it with `WHIPPET_CONFIG_OFF=1`.

### Notes
- Detect-only and conservative throughout: a finding fires only when a referent is genuinely
  broken or inert, so the SessionStart and mid-session advisories never nag. A URL download hook,
  a filename merely named in prose, and `${VAR}`/glob/`npx` script arguments are all left alone.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-06-22

Precision & recall patch for config-audit — eval-driven, every change verified against
the Claude Code docs. Corpus recall 96.5% → 98.8%, zero false positives.

### Added
- A permissions check for an **allow rule shadowed by a broader deny**: a wide glob deny
  (e.g. `Bash(git push *)`) subsumes a more specific allow (e.g. `Bash(git push origin feature/*)`),
  and since deny always wins — rule specificity does not change evaluation order — the allow
  silently never applies. The finding names both rules. (Previously only exact allow/deny
  duplicates were caught.)

### Fixed
- A hook `timeout` must be a positive **integer** number of seconds; a fractional value such
  as `2.5` is now flagged as malformed (it was silently accepted before).

## [3.0.0] - 2026-06-21

**Breaking — re-scoped to a config-only auditor.** Whippet's lean-code discipline has moved to
the `ponytail` plugin; whippet is now solely a **Claude Code config-drift auditor**. If you used
whippet for the YAGNI coding discipline, install `ponytail` instead.

### Removed
- The lean-code discipline: the `whippet` skill, the SessionStart discipline anchor
  (`whippet-activate`), the mode tracker, and the lite/full/ultra modes.
- The code↔docs drift advisory (`Stop` hook) and the `// whippet:` debt markers.
- The `whippet check` pre-commit/CI gate (`scripts/check.js`, `marker.js`) and its benchmarks.
- The dependency auditor (`deps-audit`, the `package.json` PostToolUse advisory) and its benchmarks.

### Kept
- `config-audit` — the read-only Claude Code setup audit (dead plugin/hook/MCP references, fragile
  local marketplaces, duplicate components, malformed JSON, mistyped settings keys, orphaned files).
- `/whippet-config` — the on-demand full audit.
- The quiet SessionStart advisory that speaks only on config errors (`WHIPPET_CONFIG_OFF=1` to mute).

## [2.1.1] - 2026-06-21

Precision & correctness patch. False positives found by real-world validation (24 public repos,
45 real Claude configs) and an adversarial pre-release review, all fixed test-first. Measured
accuracy is unchanged: deps-audit 96.6% precision / 85.8% recall, config-audit 96.5% recall with
zero real false positives.

### Fixed

**deps-audit — fewer false positives**
- `parseNodeMin` ignores SemVer prerelease/build tails (`>=22.0.0-rc.1` is Node 22, not 1 — which
  had silenced *every* native advisory) and reads an upper-bound-only floor as 0 (`<18` no longer
  flags natives that need a newer Node).
- A native swap gated to a recent Node (`parseArgs` / `withResolvers` / global `fetch`) is
  suppressed when `engines.node` is unknown rather than guessed at (was mis-flagging `minimist`).
- The `bundler` duplicate group is dropped — `vite` is built on `rollup` / `esbuild`, so they
  compose rather than compete (was flagging vue, rollup, mocha, vite).
- The duplicate-purpose check looks only at runtime `dependencies`; competitors kept as
  devDependencies (benchmarks, migration, plugin testing) are no longer flagged.
- The source scan reads `.vue` / `.svelte` / `.astro` / `.mdx` (plus `.mts` / `.cts`), so a
  dependency imported only inside a single-file component is no longer reported "possibly unused".

**config-audit**
- An MCP server with an unknown `type` and no command/url now gets the `no transport` error, not
  just a warning; the url-requiring transport list is derived from the transport set so it can't
  drift from it.
- A permission rule whose `(spec)` contains a newline is no longer mis-flagged as malformed.
- `env` is no longer a settings-key typo target (too short to suggest safely); it stays a
  recognized valid key.

**whippet check**
- The markers check reads the **staged blob**, not the worktree, under `--staged`; `--range`
  new-dependency detection uses the same worktree-vs-ref baseline as the rest of the gate; and
  `--range` / `--config-dir` with a missing or flag-like value now errors instead of silently
  degrading.

**marker parser**
- A trailing CR no longer defeats it, and `whippet:` now requires a comment lead — ordinary prose
  that merely mentions `whippet:` is no longer a false marker.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-06-21

### Added
- **config-audit flags a typo'd top-level settings key.** A misspelled structural key in
  `settings.json` / `settings.local.json` (e.g. `enabledPlugin` for `enabledPlugins`,
  `statusline` for `statusLine`) is valid JSON, so Claude Code silently ignores it and the
  whole feature goes dark with no error — a drift the schema can't catch at runtime. The
  audit now warns on an unknown top-level key that is a single edit from a known setting
  whose correct spelling is absent, naming the intended key. Conservative by construction:
  an unknown key far from every known setting stays silent (it may be a newer setting we
  don't list), so there are no false positives — the real hub config flags zero.
- **deps-audit native-equivalent table expanded (verified against a 106-case eval).** Added 7
  single-purpose swaps — `lodash.clonedeep`/`fast-copy` → `structuredClone`, `isarray` →
  `Array.isArray`, `es6-promise` → `Promise`, `p-defer` → `Promise.withResolvers`, `minimist` →
  `util.parseArgs`, `querystring` → `node:querystring`/`URLSearchParams` — each fact-checked against
  Node release history and gated at the major where the native is non-experimental. Lifts the
  native-check recall 81.7% → 85.8% on the eval corpus with no new false-positives.

- **config-audit catches more real settings-key typos.** A misspelled key sitting next to its
  correctly-spelled sibling is now flagged as a dead near-duplicate (was suppressed), and the typo
  distance is Damerau, so a transposition (`modle`→`model`) counts as one edit. Validated on an
  82-config labeled eval (recall 94.2% → 96.5%).

### Fixed
- **config-audit no longer false-flags valid hooks/config (4 bugs found by an 82-config eval).**
  Synced `HOOK_EVENTS` to the 30 documented events (newer ones like `PostToolUseFailure`/
  `PermissionRequest` were flagged as unknown) and made the check a hybrid — a near-miss of a known
  event is an `error` (typo), an unknown-but-far name only a `warning` (could be a newer event), so
  the autonomous advisory never hard-fails on a future event. Added `mcp_tool` to the valid hook
  types. Stopped regex-validating match-all (`*`/`""`) and exact/pipe matchers (only true regexes are
  compiled). Accepted any positive `timeout` number (not only integers). Real false-positives on the
  eval corpus: 5 → 0.
- **deps-audit no longer flags `node-fetch`/`cross-fetch` below Node 21.** Global `fetch` is
  experimental on Node 18–20 and stable only from 21, so the previous floor of 18 produced a false
  “native equivalent available” finding on Node 18/20 projects. Floor corrected to 21, lifting the
  eval precision 92.0% → 96.6%.
- **deps-audit reads a full-semver `engines.node` floor correctly.** A floor like
  `">=20.10.0"` was parsed as `min(20, 10, 0) = 0`, so the engine gate treated the
  project as running an ancient Node and silenced every native-equivalent finding.
  `parseNodeMin` now takes the major of each version token (`">=20.10.0"` → Node 20),
  restoring the `uuid`/`node-fetch`/`rimraf`/… advisories on the common semver form.
- **config-audit no longer flags a hook/statusLine glob argument as a missing script.**
  `extractScriptPath` grabbed the first token ending in a script extension, so a valid
  command like `prettier --write src/**/*.js` was read as the script path `src/**/*.js`,
  which can't resolve to a file → a false `error` finding that also flipped `whippet
  check`'s exit code. Glob metacharacters (`*`, `?`) now disqualify a token the same way
  `${VAR}`/`%VAR%` already did — a glob is never a single literal file to look for.
- **config-audit no longer flags a documented MCP wildcard permission rule as malformed.**
  `mcp__server__*` and `mcp__server__get_*` (valid, documented allow/deny rules that match
  a whole MCP server or a tool prefix) carry a `*` outside parentheses, so the rule regex
  rejected them as "malformed permission rule" — a false positive on a config shape any
  MCP-heavy setup uses. The regex now accepts a server-anchored trailing wildcard; a bare
  unanchored `mcp__*` stays flagged, matching Claude Code's own behavior.
- **config-audit version-drift compares versions numerically, not as strings.** The
  directory-marketplace check used `installed !== source`, so it labeled a plugin whose
  installed version is *ahead* of the source (a local dev build) as "plugin out of date —
  run /plugin update" (which would downgrade it), and the string compare even ordered
  `1.10.0` vs `1.9.0` backwards. It now flags only when the installed version is genuinely
  behind the source.
- **marker.js splits on every line-ending form.** `scanMarkers` split on `/\r?\n/`, so a
  file using lone-CR line endings (no LF) kept the `\r` embedded in each "line"; the marker
  regex (`.` doesn't match `\r`, `$` without `/m`) then matched nothing and every
  `// whippet:` marker went undetected. Now splits on `\r\n | \r | \n`, so markers are found
  whatever the line-ending style.
- **deps-audit no longer reports "possibly unused" from a partial scan.** `collectSources`
  caps the source walk at depth 12 / 5000 files; if a dependency's only import sat past the
  cap, the dep read as unused — a false positive from files the auditor never opened. The
  scan now records when it was truncated, and the unused check stays silent on a partial read
  (consistent with its existing "silent when no sources" behavior). The native-equivalent and
  duplicate-purpose checks, which don't depend on the source scan, are unaffected.
- **config-audit flags loose root backups, not a tidy `backups/` subdir.** The stale-backups
  check walked the `backups/` subdir and emitted one info *per file* — punishing a dedicated
  `backups/` dir (good hygiene) and mislabeling a data archive as a backup. It now flags backups
  left loose in the config-dir *root* (aggregated into one finding) and ignores a dedicated
  `backups/` subdir and data archives. Dogfooded on a real config: 19 infos → 1. Also gitignores
  `.whippet-*` runtime state files.
- **config-audit catches an MCP server with no transport.** A server in `.mcp.json` / `.claude.json`
  with no `command`, `url`, or `type` (nothing to launch or connect to) was silently passed; it is
  now an `error`.
- **config-audit version-drift tolerates a leading `v` and SemVer prerelease tags.** `cmpSemver`
  parsed raw digits, so `v2.0.0` vs `2.0.0`, and a release vs its own prerelease, produced a false
  "plugin out of date". It now strips a leading `v` and ranks a release above its prerelease
  (`1.2.0` > `1.2.0-beta`).

### Changed
- **Model-tier sweep — results in** (`benchmarks/results/2026-06-21-model-sweep.md`, raw
  rows in `runs.jsonl`). The pre-registered sweep ran: 459 observations, 3 models × 3 arms
  × 7 fixtures, n=8. Outcome: the **null** — `whippet` ties the one-line `baseline` on
  Haiku, Sonnet *and* Opus (correctness and diff size); the only robust effect is that an
  un-nudged agent writes more code, **largest on the strongest model** (the reverse of the
  "cheaper models benefit more" hypothesis). Confirms the README's convenience-wrapper
  positioning and closes the "only tested the strongest model" objection. No README change
  (it stays minimal); the measured claim lives in the results file, not the shop window.
- **Hook state file: `session_id` is sanitized before it becomes a path.** `sessionStatePath`
  interpolated `session_id` straight into the state-file name, so a value with a path separator
  (`/`, `\`, `..`) could write the file outside the config dir and permanently break per-session
  dedup (the advisory re-fired on every edit). Claude Code emits separator-free UUIDs so it
  didn't bite in practice, but a hook should never let an input field escape its dir — the id is
  now reduced to a basename-safe token.
- **deps-audit: wider native-equivalent allowlist + a `logger` duplicate group.** Added safe
  single-purpose swaps (`rfdc`/`clone-deep`→`structuredClone`, `abort-controller`→`AbortController`,
  `text-encoding`→`TextEncoder`, `is-array`→`Array.isArray`, `object-keys`→`Object.keys`), a new
  `logger` pick-one group, and members to existing groups (`undici`, `@js-temporal/polyfill`, `uvu`,
  `qunit`, `valibot`/`io-ts`/`class-validator`/`runtypes`). Honesty notes on caveated swaps
  (`uuid`→`randomUUID` is v4-only; `is-number` drops numeric-string acceptance). All engine-gated;
  conservative — bundlers stay out (vite/tsup *wrap* esbuild/rollup, a composition not a duplicate).

## [2.0.1] — 2026-06-21

### Performance
- **Merged the two PostToolUse hooks into one** (`whippet-posttooluse.js`). Every
  Edit/Write/MultiEdit fired two node spawns (drift-track + deps-check, ~50ms each on
  Windows); now one process does both jobs — ~50ms saved per edit, more on Windows.
  Behavior-preserving (same `WHIPPET_DRIFT_OFF`/`WHIPPET_DEPS_OFF` switches, per-session
  dedup, never-throws). Validated by plugin-dev:plugin-validator.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-06-21

### Changed (BREAKING)
- **Whippet is now autonomous — it mostly runs on its own.** Removed the four commands
  nobody reached for: `/whippet-review`, `/whippet-simplify`, `/whippet-ledger`,
  `/whippet-deps`. Their deterministic value moves into quiet, non-blocking hooks; the
  engines (`config-audit.js`, `deps-audit.js`, `marker.js`) are unchanged — only their
  packaging shifts from commands to hooks.
- `/whippet-config` is the **one** remaining command (the full, on-demand setup audit).
  `whippet check` stays as the opt-in pre-commit/CI gate — a script, not a slash command.
- The README is now **minimal by design**: current version + what the plugin does +
  install, nothing else.

### Added
- **Config advisory** (`SessionStart` startup → `whippet-config-check.js`) — runs the
  config audit once and surfaces a one-line advisory **only when there are errors**
  (warnings/info stay for `/whippet-config`, so it never nags). Off: `WHIPPET_CONFIG_OFF=1`.
- **Dependency advisory** (`PostToolUse` → `whippet-deps-check.js`) — when `package.json`
  changes, runs the deps audit and surfaces new native-equivalent / duplicate findings,
  deduped per session. Off: `WHIPPET_DEPS_OFF=1`.
- `sessionStatePath(kind)` factored into `whippet-drift-core.js` (`statePath` stays
  byte-compatible) + `whippet-deps-core.js`. 13-check `whippet-autonomy.test.js` (pure
  core + spawned integration), wired into `npm test`.

## [1.6.0] — 2026-06-21

### Added
- **`/whippet-deps`** — a deterministic dependency-leanness auditor, the third pillar
  beside `/whippet-config`. Flags a package the platform/stdlib already covers (curated
  1:1 allowlist, **engine-gated** so it never suggests a swap your Node floor is too old
  for), a declared-but-unused dependency (import-shaped scan + 5 escape hatches, `info`
  + *verify*), and duplicate-purpose libraries. Read-only, conservative (under-reports
  rather than cry wolf), 24 scenarios.
- **`whippet check`** — a deterministic pre-commit/CI gate (`whippet/scripts/check.js`),
  no LLM. Composes the deps audit + a bare-marker check + a staged-diff budget (and
  `/whippet-config`, opt-in), exits non-zero on a real finding **and on its own crash**
  (a gate that goes green from a bug is the worst failure). Scopes markers/budget to the
  staged diff or `--range <ref>`; `--strict`/`--json`. 11 scenarios on real temp git repos.
- **Structured `// whippet:` markers** — `| until: <condition>` names the ceiling, so
  `/whippet-ledger` and `/whippet-review` classify tracked-vs-bare **deterministically**
  (`whippet/scripts/marker.js`, the shared parser). Backward-compatible: free-form markers
  still parse as bare, and `git grep "whippet:"` still finds every one.
- **Model-tier benchmark sweep — tooling + pre-registration** (results pending). A
  per-model split in `bench-report.js` (gated on >1 model, so the single-model scoreboard
  is byte-identical until rows exist), a reproducible runner `scripts/bench-sweep.js`
  (offline `selftest` asserts the 48-cell / 384-run matrix), two harder private fixtures,
  and a pre-registered protocol ([`results/2026-06-21-model-sweep.md`](benchmarks/results/2026-06-21-model-sweep.md)).
  The Opus-only A/B is the leanest case; the sweep tests whether the discipline's edge over
  a one-liner grows on cheaper models. **No measured cross-model claim until it runs.**

### Changed
- `/whippet-config`: three new false-positive-safe checks — an invalid hook `timeout`
  (≤0 / non-integer; absent stays fine), a rule present in both `allow` and `deny` (deny
  wins, the allow is dead), an MCP server declaring both `command` and `url`. 96 scenarios.
- `/whippet-review` + `/whippet-simplify`: per-severity output + a `--json` mode, so a
  review can pipe into a gate.
- README / CLAUDE.md / plugin.json reframed around **four** tools + the gate. Honesty
  section now states the A/B measures size / dependencies / correctness only (the
  qualitative calls stay unmeasured) and that the one-liner tie is on the leanest model.

### Fixed
- `scripts/judge.js` is marked explicitly as un-run scaffolding (zero observations → no
  qualitative claim). `WHIPPET_DRIFT_THRESHOLD`'s default (3) is now self-documented in
  the hook.

## [1.5.3] — 2026-06-21

### Fixed
- **The runtime payload had silently drifted from `SKILL.md`.** The always-on anchor
  in `whippet-core.js` had dropped the `// whippet:` marker rule that `/whippet-ledger`
  exists to harvest — the command collected a marker the discipline never told the
  agent to plant — and left rung 4 ("native before a library") beside the security
  line with no carve-out (the one place getting the ladder wrong means hand-rolling
  crypto). Both restored, and `selftest.js` now asserts the load-bearing anchors stay
  in the payload, so it can't drift unnoticed again.
- **`/whippet-config` flagged a working relative hook/statusLine path as missing.** A
  relative script path was resolved against the process cwd, not the config dir, so a
  valid `"hooks/x.js"` read as broken — a false positive, the worst bug class for a
  config doctor. Now resolved against the config dir (accepted if it exists either way).

### Added
- **`/whippet-config` audits `settings.local.json` content, not just its JSON validity.**
  Its hooks, statusLine, permissions, enums, and plugin enablement override
  `settings.json` and are now checked with the same lens (local wins per key, matching
  Claude Code precedence) — the standard place per-machine drift accumulates. +8 scenarios.

### Changed
- **De-duped the review/simplify detection taxonomy.** The five shared categories were
  hand-maintained twice; `/whippet-review` now points to `/whippet-simplify`'s list for
  the shared lens and keeps only its review-only checks (marker-without-ceiling, missing
  check, oversized batch, over-cut). One source, no drift — the bloat whippet audits for.
- README: documented the commands' optional path/range argument, the drift hook's
  `WHIPPET_DRIFT_THRESHOLD` knob and its path-only limit, and the `settings.local.json`
  coverage — shipped-but-undisclosed behavior, now stated.

### Docs
- Backfilled the 1.5.0 / 1.5.1 / 1.5.2 entries below: the changelog had stopped at
  1.4.0 while the badge read 1.5.2 and three tagged releases shipped undocumented.

## [1.5.2] — 2026-06-20 — harden config-audit + non-blocking drift hooks

- config-audit: guard valid-JSON-but-wrong-shape configs (`settings.json` null/array,
  `enabledPlugins`/`hooks`/`permissions` non-object) that previously crashed the audit;
  flag `installPath: null` instead of skipping it.
- drift hooks: stream stdin instead of a blocking `readFileSync(0)`, so the Stop hook
  can't hang on a fd that doesn't close promptly.
- +13 tests (119 total): empty/malformed stdin, wrong-shape configs, Windows transcript path.

## [1.5.1] — 2026-06-20 — config-audit version drift on local marketplaces

- `/whippet-config` flags a plugin whose installed version is behind the version in its
  directory-marketplace source's `marketplace.json`. Deterministic and local (no network)
  — caught the hub's own whippet 1.4.0 vs 1.5.0 source. +2 tests (106 total).

## [1.5.0] — 2026-06-20 — config doctor + code↔docs drift hook

### Added
- **`/whippet-config`** — a deterministic, read-only config-drift audit (~18 checks:
  plugin enabled-vs-installed, cache/marketplace/hook/statusLine/MCP references, manifests,
  duplicate components, permissions, closed-set enums, frontmatter, malformed JSON, stale
  files). Covers the gaps the schema can't see.
- **code↔docs drift hook** (PostToolUse + Stop) — one quiet reminder when code changes but
  docs (`CLAUDE.md` / `README` / `docs/`) don't. Per-session state, off-switch, threshold-tunable.
- 104 isolated tests, hardened by an adversarial review (10 issues, 5 high, all fixed) and
  tried on a real hub (two false positives caught and fixed before shipping).

## [1.4.0] — 2026-06-19

### Fixed (adversarial review, round 4)
- **`detectModeChange` silently flipped mode on innocent prose** — `"normal mode"`
  in any sentence, `"stop whippet from deleting my tests"`, even asking `"should I
  use whippet full?"` all toggled state; and since the tracker only speaks on a
  change, the flip was silent (bloated diffs, no clue why). Now only a command at
  the **start of a message** flips it, the `normal mode` alias is gone, and the
  selftest locks the real prose probes instead of cherry-picked strings.
- **`loc_added` counted the net line delta** — an in-place rewrite (`return 1` →
  `return compute()`) scored 0, and LOC is the only axis with spread. Now counts
  lines added *or changed* (A/B numbers pre-date the fix; flagged in METHODOLOGY).
- **The grader ran without a timeout** — an infinite loop in a candidate (exactly
  the bug class under test) hung the harness. 10s timeout.
- **`reused` was a substring grep** — it counted a mention in a comment. Now strips
  line comments first: a call, not a mention.
- **`ponytail` (a competitor's name) was in the skill triggers** — removed.
- **README's flagship example had the `|| 0` footgun** — `Number(process.env.PORT)
  || 3000` returns 3000 for `PORT=0`, under a tagline that says "survives the edge
  cases". Fixed.
- **CI ran only `ubuntu-latest`** — the real risk surface is Windows (NTFS
  `renameSync`, Git Bash, path quoting). Added `windows-latest` to the matrix.

### Changed
- **Repositioned: the product is the three commands**, not the always-on engine.
  The drift pilot is a null and `CLAUDE.md` re-injects for free after compaction, so
  the README no longer sells the engine as the value — install-once portability plus
  the review/simplify/ledger commands is what a `CLAUDE.md` paste can't replicate.
- **Fixed the `reused` metric mislabel — whippet's last apparent edge was an
  artifact** (third review). The boolean had been recorded across three categories
  whose right answer is three *different* rungs (reuse existing code, take the
  stdlib, don't build it), so the /15 denominator pooled rungs that aren't reuse,
  and the whole reported "whippet 15/15 vs baseline 13/15" win was 2 runs in
  `trap_stdlib`. Removed the `reuse_marker` from `stdlib-uuid` and `yagni-config`
  (their real signal is already `deps_added` / `loc_added`), stripped the
  mislabelled `reused` field from those observations in `runs.jsonl` at the source
  (not just hidden in presentation), and scoped the scoreboard label to
  `trap_reuse`. Scored honestly, reuse is now 5/5 every arm — a tie. No metric
  separates whippet from the one-line baseline.
- **Deflated the benchmark apparatus to what actually ran** (second review).
  Deleted the McNemar/Wilcoxon claim from `METHODOLOGY.md` — never implemented,
  and degenerate on a 25/25 ceiling (zero discordant pairs). Cut the unrun
  LLM-judge rubric to a one-line "not run, no claim". Removed every unpopulated
  column from `bench-report.js` (no scoreboard skeleton for a study not done).
  Dropped the "Benchmarked A/B" badge — the A/B showed a tie, not a validation.
  Cut `SKILL.md` 207→118 lines: the ladder isn't re-specified three times. The
  lesson, now a methodology guardrail: a false claim in one file isn't sanctioned
  by a confession in another — delete it.
- **Applied whippet to whippet, after an adversarial review.** Cut the per-turn
  reminder: the discipline now re-anchors at `SessionStart` (which fires on
  `compact`) and on an explicit mode change, not on every turn — removing an
  ~80-token-per-turn tax that whippet's own rung 1 says to cut. Aligned the
  SKILL's ultra-mode claim to the code (mode flips on `/whippet <level>` or
  `whippet <level>`, not on bare prose like "ultra mode"; selftest locks it).
  Trimmed the SKILL's opening flourish. README: dropped the misattributed "5×"
  hero number — it's the one-line baseline's result too, so crediting whippet
  with it was self-report by attribution. The honest pitch is now packaging
  (install-once portability, mode control, the commands), not a measured artifact
  or drift edge; the [A/B note](benchmarks/results/2026-06-19-opus-ab.md) carries
  the full verdict and the drift-test protocol.
- Reworded the skill, the injected hook text, and the README so the ladder, the
  guards, the "runnable check" rule, and the level table are whippet's own words,
  not Ponytail's — credit stays, borrowed phrasing doesn't.
- Reporting is now terse *by construction*: the discipline ships the mechanical
  levers (cut-word list, lead-with-result, keep-code-verbatim, a Not/Yes example)
  instead of only describing terseness — so `full` actually reads differently.
- Added an anti-*under*-building guard (YAGNI targets speculation, not a justified
  seam) and positioned whippet against Anthropic's official anti-over-engineering
  guidance.

### Added
- **Drift-test harness** (`benchmarks/drift/`) — the executable form of the one
  experiment that can settle whippet's value: does the discipline persist across
  compaction *better* than a `CLAUDE.md` paste, or only as well? Three arms with
  identical content, different vehicle (A paste-once / B CLAUDE.md / C whippet);
  `discipline.txt` is held byte-equal to whippet's injected payload by a selftest;
  naive subject sessions (observer-effect controlled) run a fixed `task-stream.md`,
  meet the existing fixtures as traps after each `/compact`, and are scored by
  `score-drift.js` (reuses `bench-score.js`, adds the arm/session/compaction
  dimensions + a per-trap `lean_compliant` flag). `drift-report.js` reports per-arm
  compliance with Wilson CIs and the decisive **B-vs-C** gap. `PROTOCOL.md` is the
  step-by-step (isolated `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` per arm, sample size, honest limits).
  Pre-registered prediction: **C ≈ B ≫ A** — whippet beats forgetting to persist,
  ties persisting via CLAUDE.md. Wired into `npm test`; not yet run.
- `/whippet-simplify`: the apply half of `/whippet-review`. Runs the same lean
  lens (dead code, reinvented logic, redundant deps, premature abstraction) and
  applies the behavior-preserving cuts — language-agnostic, mode-aware — while
  refusing to simplify away validation, security, or the runnable check. Leaves
  the tree clean and a check passing; risky cuts are flagged, not applied.
- Release tooling: `npm run bump <version>` keeps the version in sync across
  `package.json`, both manifests, and the README badge; `scripts/check-manifests.js`
  fails the build (via `npm test`) on any desync or a hooks.json pointing at a
  missing file.
- Benchmark harness v2 ([`benchmarks/METHODOLOGY.md`](benchmarks/METHODOLOGY.md)):
  three paired arms (off / one-line baseline / whippet), real fixture repos with
  hidden graders under `benchmarks/fixtures/`, an objective scorer
  (`scripts/bench-score.js`: correctness gate + LOC/deps/reuse), and an aggregator
  (`npm run bench`) with Wilson confidence intervals and per-category splits.
- Three trap fixtures (`reuse-slugify`, `stdlib-uuid`, `yagni-config`) and an
  LLM-judge (`scripts/judge.js`) for the qualitative metrics — rubric-based,
  reference-guided, position-bias-controlled (judge swapped, a win counts only
  both ways), model-agnostic. Its resolver ships a runnable check in `npm test`.
- Repo dev hook: edits to the hooks, scripts, or a manifest auto-run the suite
  and report a failure back (whippet dogfooding its own "always-on check").

## [1.2.1] — terser default reporting

- Report in the fewest lines that answer (often one).

## [1.2.0] — honest benchmarks + selftest

- Honest A/B benchmark screen; hooks selftest; README re-pitched to the real value.

## [1.1.0] — always-on

- SessionStart + UserPromptSubmit hooks keep the discipline on across the session
  and through compaction.

## [1.0.0] — initial release

- The `whippet` skill (YAGNI ladder, dependency hygiene, leave-a-check, terse
  reporting) plus `/whippet-review` and `/whippet-ledger`.
